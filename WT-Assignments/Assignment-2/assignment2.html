<h3>Parrot is based on Debian's testing branch (Buster), with a Linux 5.2 kernel. It follows a rolling release development model.<p>
The desktop environments are MATE and KDE, and the default display manager is LightDM.</p>
<p>
The system is certified to run on devices which have a minimum of 256MB of RAM, and it is suitable for both 32-bit (i386) and 64-bit (amd64) processor architectures. Moreover, the project is available for ARMv7 (armhf) architectures.
</p><p>
In June 2017, the Parrot Team announced they were considering to change from Debian to Devuan, mainly because of problems with the highly controversial systemd.
As of January 21st, 2019, the Parrot team has begun to phase out the development of their 32-bit (i386) ISO. </h3></h2>

  <h2 id="e"><b><font color="White">Editions:</font></b>
      <p>Parrot has multiple editions that are based upon Debian, with various desktop environments available.
</p><br>

<h2><font color ="white">Parrot Security:</font></h3>
<h3><p>Parrot is intended to provide a suite of penetration testing tools to be used for attack mitigation, security research, forensics, and vulnerability assessment.</p>
 <p> It is designed for penetration testing, vulnerability assessment and mitigation, computer forensics and anonymous web browsing.</h3>
</p>
</br>
<h2><font color ="white">Parrot Home:</font></h2>
<h3><p>Parrot Home is the base edition of Parrot designed for daily use, and it targets regular users who need a lightweight, always updated and beautiful system on their laptops or workstations.
</p>
<p>The distribution has the same look and feel of a regular Parrot environment and includes all the basic programs for daily work. Parrot Home also includes programs to chat privately with people, encrypt documents with the highest cryptographic standards or surf the net in a completely anonymous and secure way.
</p>
<p>
The system can also be used as a starting point to build a very customized pentesting platform with only the tools you need, or you can use it to build your professional workstation by taking advantage of all the latest and most powerful technologies of Debian without a hassle.

<h2><font color ="white">Parrot ARM:</font></h2>

<h3><b>A lightweight Parrot release for embedded systems, designed for simplicity and portability is currently available for Raspberry Pi devices.

  <h2 id="p"><b><font color="White">Parrot OS tools:</font></b>
    <p>
There are multiple Tools in Parrot OS which are specially designed for Security Researchers and are related to penetration testing. A few of them are listed below, more tools in Parrot OS can be found on the official website.
</p>
<h2><font color ="white">TOR:</font></h2>


<h3>TOR also is known as The Onion Router is a distributed network that is used for anonymity and privacy and is used by Activists, Hacktivists, Ethical Hacker, Black Hat Hackers and other people who want to hide their activities online. It is designed in a way that the IP Address of the client using TOR is hidden from the server that the client is visiting and the data and other details are hidden from the client’s Internet Service Provider (ISP). TOR network uses hops to encrypt the data between client and server, and that’s why it provides better anonymity than a VPN. TOR network and TOR browser are pre-installed and configured in Parrot OS.
</h3>
<h2><font color ="white">Onion Share:</font></h2>

<h3>Onion Share is an open-source utility that is used to share files of any size over the TOR network securely and anonymously. It is so secure and so simple to use, just drag your file and drop it to the OnionShare. It will then generate a long random URL that can be used by the recipient to download the file over the TOR network using TOR browser.
</h3>
<h2><font color ="white">AnonSurf:</font></h2>
<h3>
Anonsurf is a utility that makes whole operating system communication to go over TOR, I2P or other anonymizing networks. You don’t need an extra browser or anything for it. It doesn’t make only your browser communication secure but it also anonymizes your P2P communication and a lot of other communication protocols. You can start or restart Anonsurf service from Parrot Sec menu, for CLI options
